## Naomi's GitHub Page

This page is available at https://naomismith.me/

Currently unavailable as github only allows 1 user site host per account (fair enough lol) so I've assigned this to a separate private github project.

This page will later be used to present:
- My past experience / work experience
- Any awards / achievements
- Volunteer work
- Personal Projects through GitHub
- How to contact me

Please come back later for more details!
